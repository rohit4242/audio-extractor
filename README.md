# Audio Extractor: Efficient Video to Audio Conversion

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The **Audio Extractor** is a powerful web application designed to simplify the process of extracting audio from various video formats.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design with drag-and-drop functionality for easy file uploads.
- **Multiple Format Support**: Convert videos from formats like MP4, AVI, and MOV to audio formats such as MP3, WAV, and AAC.
- **High-Quality Output**: Utilizes **FFmpeg** for maintaining audio quality during extraction.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visual indicators for monitoring conversion progress.
- **Offline Functionality**: Convert videos without needing a constant internet connection.
- **Error Handling and Notifications**: Robust mechanisms to inform users of any issues during the process.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.
- **Customizable Audio Settings**: Adjust bitrate and sample rate for optimized audio output.
- **Batch Processing**: Upload and convert multiple video files simultaneously.

## Technical Stack
